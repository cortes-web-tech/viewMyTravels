# ETL Script

_The `getPictureMetadata.sh` script the user to extract data from a folder_

To use it:

- clone this repository
- make your own "pics" folder
- add pictures to the folder
- Open a Terminal window with this folder (not the pics folder) as the working directory
- Run the following command:

```bash
bash getPictureMetadata.sh
```

The script will run and display some data along the way.

_This was made as a tool for a website I'm working on._
